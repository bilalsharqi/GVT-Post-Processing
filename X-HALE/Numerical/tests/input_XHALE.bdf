$ Nastran Input File for the X-HALE Aircraft based on Data from UM/NAST
$ original File by Markus
$ 12/2018 current revisions done by Bilal - the term "removed_cbeams" refers to the removal of CBEAMS
$ to connect the CONM2s (for the wings distirbuted mass entries) to the wing using beam elements
$ the distributed masses are now assigned offset from the grid points used for the wing CBEAMS
